# Arduino Radar Using Servo Motor SG91R
Simple Arduino Uno project with Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 and Servo Motor SG91R and other basic kits

# Construct the circuit by following-
  
  => connect GND VCC connection of Sonar
   => white wire of Servo is the VCC, Brown is the GND and Orange is the output signal. So connect VCC and GND of the Servo
   => Now connect echo and trig pin of Sonar

Thats it !! now join the coding Section

# 1. First upload the Radar_ard.ino File and Edit your pin number according to your circuit.
# 2. Upload the Arduino Processing Code.
# 3. Open the Processing IDE
