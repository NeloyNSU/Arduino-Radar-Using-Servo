 Construct the circuit by following-
  
  => connect GND VCC connection of Sonar
   => white wire of Servo is the VCC, Brown is the GND and Orange is the output signal. So connect VCC and GND of the Servo
   => Now connect echo and trig pin of Sonar

Thats it !! now join the coding Section

1. First upload the Radar_ard.ino File and Edit your pin number according to your circuit.
2. Upload the Arduino Processing Code.
3. Open the Processing IDE
